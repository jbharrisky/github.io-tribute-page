     On May 27, 1995, Reeve became quadriplegic after being thrown from a horse during an equestrian competition. In the years following the accident, Reeve returned to creative work, directing In the Gloaming (1997) and receiving a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Golden Globe Award nomination for his performance in the television remake of Rear Window (1998). He also made several appearances in the Superman-themed television series Smallville.

Beginning in the 1980s, Reeve advocated for environmental and human-rights causes, and for federal funding of the arts. After the accident, he lobbied for spinal cord injury research, including human embryonic stem cell research, and for better insurance coverage for people with disabilities. His advocacy work included founding the Christopher Reeve Foundation and co-founding the Reeve-Irvine Research Center. Reeve died on October 10, 2004, at the age of 52.
